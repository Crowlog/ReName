<h1>ReName</h1>
<h3>A small website I made for finding a new name</h3>
<p>Visit the website: <a href="https://crowlog.github.io/ReName/">https://crowlog.github.io/ReName/</a></p>
<br>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Choose the gender of the names</li>
  <li>Switch between different generators</li>
  <li>Export and import save files</li>
  <li>See which names you liked / disliked</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h2>What is this website for?</h2>
<p>I couldn't think of a new name for myself, so I made this site to help me find a new one.</p>
<p>And maybe someone finds it useful too.</p>
